# Language Translator Model Using Encoder And Decoder

Here, I am building a flexible train and predict/inference process where Model should handle variable size of input/output and with high accuracy.
Enoder encodes the sequence input into a new representation. This representation is called Context Vector. Decoder decodes the Context Vector into output sequence
